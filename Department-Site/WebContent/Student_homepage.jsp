            <p style="color: white"> Computer Science subjects complement the disciplines  of mathematics, science, economics, business, art, philosophy, geography,  linguistics, rhetoric and communication, psychology, and sociology. <strong></strong></p>
		<p style="color: white">		  The computer science majors combine many topics in  computing practice with mathematical material on its foundations,  including prediction and modeling of efficiency, meaning and form in  programming languages, and the fundamental limits of computing. </p>
		<p style="color: white"> Students with primary interests in particular  applications of computing can combine a major in computer science with a major  or minor in another discipline. Such combinations may be attractive to  prospective employers because of today's growing demand for well-prepared  specialists.</p>
